Introduce Yourself? 
Let me start by some personal info:
My name is Snehasish Kumar Paul.
I was born and brought up in Nagpur, Maharashtra, where I did my schooling from KV Nagpur. After that I have completed my UG from GCOEA in ENTC stream. 
Now talking about my Work Experience-
Basically I have been part of two very different Organizations. 1st is TCS and 2nd is Sports365.
In TCS I have worked for around 21 months as EIS, PLM Developer. In TCS, I used to worked for Ashok Leyland as a client resource. There I have worked as technical expertise where I did 3 things- 1st is system development using software tools like java, HTML, MQL, Oracle Database where we have created an upgradeed version of an system which has speed up the process and improved the efficiency by 20%. 2nd is Coordinating with client team to understand the requirement and ensure on time delivery and quality management and the 3rd one is Developing user test cases and creating reports summarizing work completion status.
2nd organization is Sports365
In my summers I have interned with Sports 365 as Sales and Marketing Intern. Basically Sports365 is a E-commerce based platform which provides one stop solution for all sporting requirements. In my internship I did 3 things, 1st is Sales where I have generated 16 leads, 2nd is Social Media Marketing, and the 3rd one is Research project  Titled " Digital Transformation in Sports Industry".
Apart from this I have experience in managing event and also I was a part of the event sponsorship team during my college stint.
I have won many awards latest one being is that I was awarded 5* rating for my performance in TCS and also awarded best performer of the quater for 3 consecutive times. Also, In my college We were one of the finalists of National Robotics competion where more than 100+ teams have participated all over the India. I have won Cricket tournamnets for my both school and college teams multiple times.

Now, Speaking about my hobbies, I have always been a sports person throughout my school days. I have participated in lots of different sports events, particularly 4- Cricket, Football, Kho-Kho and Athletics. I have represented my school and college team in cricket in regional level.
And now talking about about my character, I would love to describe it in 3 points
1st is I am very hardworking, 
2nd is I am very patient i.e I have the ability to stay calm under pressure,
and the last one is that I quickly adapt myself to any situation.

That's all about me. 






Why MBA?
First is, to learn different skills set or to broaden my skill set. As earlier I was working for TCS as a technical expertise I.e  I was more in a technical things. But I feel that I can do this job as well as the managerial job within the domain if I understand many perspectives that are involved in business. Earlier what was happening is that I was doing work for the organization but I was not aware of the business perspective of it. (Let me give you one example...I was working with Ashok Leyland on a project which was related to Costa Rica....In India generally what we see is that colour of most vehicles are either Black, Yellow or Red....but when We were developing the model for Costa Rica we were designing the vehicle of Blue and Beige were prime colors....when I asked about this they told me that based on the survey done by their marketing team the preferred color of that region was blue and beige. So this is the primary reason to do MBA.) If I understand how the marketing works, what are the finances involved to build a product from initial stage to final product. How logistics work. If I understand all these aspects then only I will be able to do my job much better. That is one of the reason to do MBA i.e. to broaden my skill set. To gain more business domain knowledge. 
Secondly persuing MBA has given me a Holistic view or Big Picture View of how business runs. Before MBA what I was lack was better understanding of the surroundings, what is the rationale behind this marketing approach and all. How the business is evolving and what will change in future. Doing an MBA will equip me with all these views to make a better decision maker. Also, It will enhance my orientation skill and enable me to contribute smartly to the business world. 




Short Term Goal

I think it is really important to set goals for yourself.  Throughout my career, I've always created short-term goals to help guide my career advancement at a steady and realistic pace. Now my short term goals would be to quickly settle into the new role and learn as much as possible and help the company grow. Because this is the beginning and most of the learning happens during initial stages only. The 1st two years would be to gain as much as experience and knowledge as possible. To get as much exposure as possible so that I can take up higher responsibilities whenever needed and prepare myself for the future advancements. 

Mid term goal

Few years down the line, I would love to see myself in a strategic position such as heading the sales/marketing of a particular product category, where I can take decisions which have a big impact on the company’s operations and can execute my suggestions and ideas to enhance the company growth.

Long term goal

My long term goal would be to take up on leadership role and be an integral part of senior management team. After working for long period still there will be certain things that I needed to explore or do the things my way. That could be achieved by taking extra responsibilities and be in a leadership position. 




Why shouldn't we hire you? 
If you are looking for someone whom you can micromanage means just like robot then I think I am not that candidate.  I work better when I'm given some general guidelines with the desired outcome and am then allowed some freedom regarding how I would carry out that task.
Also You shouldn't hire me if an extrovert wouldn't fit in well at your company or in this job. 







Why should we hire you?
Apart from the sales and marketing skills required for this job,the most important thing is interpersonal skills, building relationships among different people of different background and also managing network is the key. And I think till now I have done this successfully throughout my career. In my college I have organized event, I was the POC for the event sponsorship team ( I have build good relations there with my peers and also different organization people), I have lead my team during my stint with TCS, also I have lead my school and college team in sports which reflects my leadership skills and good fit for team. During my work tenure with TCS I was awarded the 5* rating for my performance and I was awarded best performer for 2 consecutive quarters which reflects my ability to work under pressure and in team situation. I have good presentation and orientation skills. Also during my SIP I have acquired good negotiation skills which I believe is very important for any situation, which also reflects my good communication skills. In addition to this I have good analytical and problem solving skills. I have a hand on experience on tools like SAP, SPSS, R, Python, SQL which I think will come in handy in some stage. Earlier also I have worked with clients so I know the expectations from them and how to deliver the project. Also I am very quickly adaptable to any situation for example 4 years I was in hostel during my college, also for TCS first I was in Trivandrum and then move to Chennai where no one knows Hindi but I quickly got familiar with every one of my team members. So I think I am good fit for this job.










What makes you stand out from other candidates applying for this position?
High level of creativity or Good Analytical and Problem solving skills
Leadership qualities
Negotiation and persuasion skills
Presentation skills
Self-motivation
Ability to stay calm and focused under pressure

High level of creativity- I believe there is no standard definition of creativity, it can be anything, you can be creative about anything, the way you do things. For me the way way I talk to people is creative in itself. How I manage my network is unique and different from others. And for example if I have to give creativity in my work then in our curriculum there was a course called Design Thinking and Innovation..where our group has developed an website which was very creative. The topic for our project was how will you popularize DT in schools, so we have developed an quizzing website based on snakes and laddder. Which was very fun and at the same time you can learn also.

Leadership qualities- I have taken leadership role many times in my carrer, I was captain of my university cricket team. Also, I was the head of Event Sponsorship team during college fests. I like to take initiatives whenever possible, here in my MBA journey also, I always take initiatives whle doing group activities.

Negotiation and persuasion skills- In my summers I was doing sales job, there I understand how to approach for a structured negotiations, before that it was all about un-structured negotiations, this is something that we are doing throughout our life but it was with the ones whom we know they know us, but here while working for company I have to do negotiations with clients or people we don't know which brings out the challenge. In this case you have to be really good with your propositions and you should make them feel important which is the key to negotiation and I was given good feedback by my mentor. so that's why I consider myself as good negotiator.

Ability to stay calm and focused under pressure- As MBA journey is not very easy, you have to be mentally very strong because each and every day there comes a challenge, you are meeting big leaders or taking part in competions, so you get that confidence in yourself to stay calm and you get the understanding of the situation and respond accordingly. Take this example only, here I am sitting with you, yes I am little bit of nervous, but at the same time I am quite excited for this also, so there is a balance that every individual have to find, which I believe I handle effectively.

Describe your Leadership Style?
Lead by facilitating communication: “Communication is one of my greatest strengths. I lead by facilitating open communication, and trying to bring out the best in every team member”.
Lead by delegating and making others better: “I’m great at delegating and finding the strengths of other team members. I try to give each person a chance to do what they’re best at and create a team effort that delivers a result that’s greater than the sum of its parts”. And for this to happen communication is the key. I believe in a team environment you have to treat every individual differently as everyone does not have same personality so you have to make sure how you are dealing with individuals. You have to make everyone feel important.




Describe your Communication Style?
Assertive- I think that I always express my own needs, desires, ideas and feelings, while also considering the needs of others. I always take ownership of my tasks and while communicating I maintain positive eye contact which makes the other person intersted. I Voice my needs and desires confidently.




Can you work under pressure? *
Pressure is in every task that we do. Taking the example of my MBA journey, here in 75 days we have been taught 8 subjects, we have to prepare final projects for each of this subjects, we have to pass in every subject with more than 70% to get good placement offers, attendance should be more than 80% percent. Other than all the academics work, we have college cultural activities, prepare for placements, doing online courses for self upgrading our skills. So, in just this small span of time, we are doing all this work. There isn't a day where there is a free schedule. So, in whatever task we do,we are under pressure to come out the best. Till now, I have able to perform all the activities mentioned above with great result. Apart from all this, I have worked in TCS where I have to complete my tasks within a deadline and respond to a client within a given deadline.




What motivates you to do good job? *
Recognition and being appreciated for my efforts motivates me. Apart from this there are other internal and external factors are there that motivates me. Internal factors is being in a competitive environment,doing my best to do a better job than my colleagues. I feel like if my colleagues can do a job than Ican also do it. And other external factors of motivation for me is money, fame(recognition) for good work.




Give an example of your creativity? *
In my view,creativity is something which can't be define by some of alphabets,its just a reaction according to the situation,and the result in itself is creativity.
Creativity is not about creating new thoughts, it is about improving things which can also be referred as modification. Every action I take in my day to day life is unique in itself, which can also be referred .as creativity.




Explain how you would be an asset to this organization? *
I have good communication skills, which is an biggest asset. As building
networking is the key to any business. Being an extrovert helps me bond better with others.

Hardworking- I was awarded 5* rating for my performance, I was also awarded best employer for 3 consecutive quarters. I was being praised by both my SIP mentor and also by mentor during short term project mentor for the work I did.
Adaptability- After 12th I move to a city Amravati which was mostly dominated by Maharashtrians and people speak in their local languages, I have spen 4 years there and also during my work-ex I was in Trivandrum and then in chennai for almost 2 years so I have adapted well there and came out with flying colors.
Flexibility- I did my MBA preparation with my Job so I was quite flexible in that regard and also here we are doing STPs, academics, sports so managing all these activities you have to be flexible and I believe that I am excelling in all of these areas.

Why Marketing?
Marketing is a advertising activity. It is Creating brand awareness in the market and generates demand for the product. This activity is to identify the customer demand and then come up with a solution. It let the customer decide whether they want the product or not. 
Marketing is a pull strategy where customer demands the product after seeing advertisement whereas sales is a pull strategy.
(a) An Open Arena: 
What interests me the most about marketing is that unlike finance or other domains it has no set rules to follow, we have an open arena to innovate and pour in all our creativity. It’s like a blank slate and it’s up to the marketer to employ his creative genius and craft the most compelling proposition.
(b) Demand Never Slumps: 
“The marketing industry has existed right from the time humans decided to brush their teeth, wash themselves, wash their clothes, groom themselves, clean their homes, and since then the demand has only grown. Talking of the FMCG industry alone, the FMCG industry is growing at approximately 15%, with changing lifestyles of the consumers and the untapped potential of rural markets, it is bound to grow even more in future. This disproportionate growth opportunity intrigues me.”
(c)  Directly Impacts the Way People Live: 
“There’s a constant interplay between marketing and societal changes. The potential of marketing to adapt itself to the changes in the society at times, and to change the society itself the others is what excites me to be a part of this change. It enables you to directly impact the way people live, dress, communicate, among so many other aspects. ”
(d) Constantly Innovate & Learn: 
“Marketing entails immense learning opportunities as you get to work at the grassroots with the customers, trying to feel their pulse and understand their psyche. Moreover, the consumers and their consumption habits change dynamically, therefore, it requires you to be on your toes always and keeps you reinvigorated with constant change to innovate and change.”

Why Consulting?
When I got picked up by TCS after graduation...you know at that time IT industry was something that I always wanted to do be a part of. Means I was good with softwares and languages. So that intersts me. So, I was in chennai workig for TCS, in my team there were few consultants with whom I have formed good relations there. Before that I was not very sure about what consulting is all about. But when I became friends with those colleagues there I came to know about the consulting roles. Means what they do...they were always working with different clients. And I have observed that in one year they have worked for three different organizations. The kind of exposure those consultants get was quite fascinating to see. That's when I have started developing interest about taking up an consultant role. I believe the opportunities that you get in these roles ...that is to solve big problems which has a really wide impact is something that I look forward to. Every few monts I will get to start working on a new project. So, there will be ample opportunities of learning new things and get to know about different industries, market scenarios. So, this the kind of role that I have thinking for last few years that I want to work on. So, that's whay consulting is my top most priority. And I believe to be part of consultant firm you should be extrovert and should have good  communication and listening skills. You should have good decision making skills and . And I believe I posses this qualities in me. Which can be an added advantage for me in consultant role.
