Brand
A brand is an intangible marketing or business concept that helps people identify a company, product, or individual.
People often confuse brands with things like logos, slogans, or other recognizable marks, which are marketing tools that help promote goods and services. 

Brand Equity
Brand equity refers to the value a company gains from its name recognition when compared to a generic equivalent.
Brand equity has three basic components: consumer perception, negative or positive effects, and the resulting value.
When a company has positive brand equity, customers willingly pay a high price for its products, even though they could get the same thing from a competitor for less. Customers, in effect, pay a price premium to do business with a firm they know and admire.

Brand Equity Model
Keller’s logic behind the model is simple — to have a strong brand, one must create the right brand image, by constructing ideal brand encounters or experiences. Each experience with your brand should leave customers, or potential customers, with positive thoughts, emotions, and convictions. When you are able to prove that your brand can provide value, then you’ve built brand equity and the customer’s convictions will spread to others.
